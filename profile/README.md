### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Suraj Vishwakarma**, a full-stack developer based in Bangalore, India.

All the repositories in this GitHub organization â€” **[whateverui](https://github.com/whateverui)** â€” are **archived projects** from my early learning days. These were built while I was exploring new tech through project-based learning â€” so expect a mix of incomplete, experimental, and fun-but-silly ideas.

I've moved them here to keep things organized and transparent. While theyâ€™re not all polished, they might still help someone learning or looking for ideas â€” feel free to explore!

ðŸ”— For all my active and current projects, check out my main GitHub profile: [**@smartcraze**](https://github.com/smartcraze)

ðŸ§  Currently learning:

* **Rust for backend development**
* **Web3 fundamentals**
* Deep diving into **DevOps**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**
* Practicing **DSA** and preparing for upcoming placement drives

Thanks for stopping by!
