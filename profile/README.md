### Welcome to `surajarchive`
A collection of my early, experimental, and half-built projects â€” moved here for transparency and nostalgia.
These were built while learning new tech, so expect chaos, creativity, and a few useful ideas.
Feel free to explore or fork anything you find interesting.
For my current work, visit [**@smartcraze**](https://github.com/smartcraze).
